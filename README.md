This is the ReadMe of the AAC. the template for this project was taken from https://github.com/catiembaker/AACNestedHW

This project has a homescreen containing images. When the images are pressed, they go into more images that have strings associated with them.
When those images are pressed, a text-to-speech program says the associated text.
The interface on this project can also add new images to the homescreen.
